<p>The Nobel Prize is perhaps world's most well known scientific award. <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred-nobel/">Alfred Nobel</a> was an inventor, entrepreneur, and scientist who also wrote poetry and drama. He was famous for inventing dynamite and was holder of 355 patents. Every year it's given to scientist, and scholars in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, economics and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. An exploratory data analysis had been done on the dataset available and a set of insights had been gleaned. You can find the insights that I'd gleaned from the dataset of Nobel laureates from the year 1901 through 2016 in my Jupyter notebook which is available in this repository as well as the Nobel laureates dataset.</p>
